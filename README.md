# DevSphere

Greetings!!! Welcome to my personal project - DevSphere. This webapp is meant to be a social network for developers to showcase themselves for recruiters and other developers.
Well, that is the theme at least.. The true purpose of this project is to teach myself reactjs, and also to build something small for fun.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Reactjs](https://react.dev/).
