# DEVSPHERE

### Greetings!

Welcome to my personal project - DevSphere. This webapp is meant to be a social network for developers to showcase themselves for recruiters and other developers.
Well, that is the theme at least.. The true purpose of this project is to teach myself reactjs, and also to build something small for fun.

### Instructions for viewing project
```bash
# Download the app to local machine
git clone https://github.com/V4N1LLA-1CE/dev-sphere.git ~/Downloads/dev-sphere

# Move into project directory
cd ~/Downloads/dev-sphere

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start project
npm start
```
After completing the steps above, enter in `localhost:3000` in the URL bar of a web browser (Chrome, Safari etc.) 

I hope you liked this small little project! :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Reactjs](https://react.dev/).
